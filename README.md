## Introduction

## Who we are

The Smith Busters are a group of aspiring MSIS graduate students who are enthusiastic about data and want to emphasize the importance of data analytics in today's data-driven world. We are ready to apply and present the knowledge we have gained as data analysts both inside and outside of the University of Maryland in order to make a difference in the communities.

The SmithBusters are Rishikesh Baskaran, Yash Makadia, Satvik Narang, Anushka Ranjan, Shweta Salelkar, and Nahome Yeshitila.


## What we are doing


The Smithbusters will produce visualizations using data from the US Census to help us visualize where places require assistance in any of the characteristics specified, such as education, employment etc. We will make predictions about how the numerous criteria we investigate impact the income and livelihood of Americans in various ways. SmithBuster intends to answer the following question with this data.

In order to build this index, we will need to evaluate answers to the following questions:

1. What is the median household income in the United States? How does median income vary in different states and what is the distribution of type of employment of people in the states?
2. How does the distribution of education levels and employment of the population within a state impact the income?
3. Can there be a model which can be trained to understand the  effect of each factor on income and estimate the income for a given state based on these factors?
4. Based on the income predicted by the model, does a state have an opportunity to improve their median household income and what are the factors that can help in achieving this?



## Why these questions matter: 
#### Part 1
Learning which states are doing well and which fall short of the national average requires knowledge of the median income of American families and how it varies from state to state. Our research will focus on high-income states to learn the employment structure that has contributed to their success. With that, the states trailing behind automatically become our choice of interest to focus on in the later parts of our report.
#### Part 2
A popular belief is that better education will lead to more job opportunities and a higher income. We're here to find out if that's true by comparing the levels of education in the state with the most income and the state with the least. If their level of education and income are directly related, education would be a straightforward task to focus on.
#### Part 3
We will need a working model to put our analysis to use and know right away from the predicted income if a state has room for improvement.
#### Part 4 
When our model does show that there is room for change, we will need to know which factors to start working on right away and how important each one is so that organizations can decide what to work on first.


## How will we accomplish this? (Description of dataset)

Our data was obtained from the US Census data website (https://data.census.gov/). We have obtained information on the below factors for the year 2020:

Table Name -> Description  
DP03       -> Economic characteristics 
DP05       -> Demographic and housing estimates    
S1501      ->  Educational attainment   
S2506       Financial characteristics for housing units 


Each of these tables consists of data for zipcode of US. In order to join relevant columns from these tables, we use Zip code as the primary key to join the above tables to create a consolidated dataset.

The columns we chose for our analysis largely had to do with how they relate to our objective. We needed to understand what factors affected the income of an individual and how his income affects his living conditions. DP03 gave us data on the income and income characteristics for the population and DP05 was about population characteristics and ethnicity. We used S1501 to understand the levels of educational attainment and of how many people in a city were educated up to high school, college and undergrad level. S2506 gave us two columns that informed us the mortgaged houses and what the median value was. <be>

## Conclusion:
<br>
For variable identification, we looked at factors (such as jobs) required by the community by assigning weights to sub-factors (such as public, private, and self-employment) and converting absolute numbers provided for these factors into proportions to compare geographies. Following that, we developed a highly dynamic predictive model based on linear regression with an accuracy of 83%. This model assists us in determining which states have room for improvement in terms of income. If our predicted value is higher than what the current average income is, we conclude that the stateâ€™s conditions can be bettered.<br>

The Community Needs Index (CNI) analysis discusses the areas that can be improved within a state. We have brought down 39 columns of data into just 4 major factors. This will help people understand the needs of a state on a broader scope. They also have the opportunity to delve into the data at a sub-factor level. <br>

Alabama was chosen as an example because its income could increase by 6.7%. So, when we conducted an in-depth analysis, we discovered that, while affordable housing was 18% lower than the national average, transportation in the state was less than 43% of the national average, and employment was 17% lower than the national average.<br>

With this in-depth analysis, we can easily conclude that the state of Alabama or any magnanimous organization should prioritize transportation before addressing other issues.<br>


## Takeaways for organizations (business outcome):
<br>
Aside from the obvious interests that NGOs and governments have in the CNI, the best clients are for-profit organizations that want to improve their CSR activities. Big organizations take responsibility for giving back to the community, and it is common to see them construct parks, schools, overhead bridges, and restore landscapes that benefit the environment, among so many others.
<br>
With this model, any organization can easily understand the community's true needs, focusing on the pain points of each individual at the state level. This assists businesses in achieving accurate results and, as a result, receiving praise, adoration, and brand recognition.
<br>
<br>
Future iterations of the model and its scope:<br>
Now that we have a model that works at the state level, we can replicate it down to the zip code level. As a result, even smaller organizations and philanthropists can help uplift communities around them beyond their own capacity.
