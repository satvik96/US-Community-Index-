Building an index to help government keep a track of geographical areas in US where people require support  


## "Are we doing okay?" - The Community Need Index may have answers.


Many a time, we as a community find ourselves in a conundrum. "Is my town doing good?", "Are my needs getting met?", "Do I walk more than I should to get the most basic of things?", these are things we usually ponder about. The Smithbusters, however, took it personally. The Community Need Index (CNI) provides us with tons of data on how a region in the US is doing. Ideally, the CNI is a great place to start looking and diving deep into. 


The Community Need Index (CNI) is a regional code-based score that accounts for a community's unmet needs with respect to livelihood and is publicly accessible via the internet.

To understand the trends for the Needs Index, the Smithbusters will use US Census data from 2020. It is a multi-dimensional non-profit assessment of needs in the United States. As part of the Census, the United States government collects data from the population on various parameters such as Demographics, Education, Income, and so on.


The analysis that stems from the Common Needs Index ("CNI") can be used by non-profit and community-based organizations to develop initiatives that best address the needs of a given community and, as a result, elevate their status. The predictive model will identify CNI core competencies that can be shared with community partners in order to justify grants, allocate resources, or even put in place better policies.
